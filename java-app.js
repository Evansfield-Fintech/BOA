Welcome to DevOps Training.
DevOps is good. It makes the mind work smarter.
This module on github branching makes for a lot of reflection to understand the concept.
Now, It would be interesting to see what the next sets of modules would bring.
There were some challenging sections in the shell scripting module. However, with patience, I learnt the various commands for managing condition (if else and switch cases), load tests (using for-loop and while-loop), and funtions that contain nested if arguments.

With patience and dedication, we shall excel.

With Jehovah by my side, I will not run and hide, My God is with me. This, I know!
