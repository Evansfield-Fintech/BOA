Welcome to DevOps Training
Now, It would be interesting o see what the next sets of modules would bring.
There were some challenging sections in the shell scripting module. However, with patience, I learnt the various commands for managing condition (if else and switch cases), load tests (using for-loop and while-loop), and funtions that contain nested if arguments.

With patience and dedication, we shall excel.
